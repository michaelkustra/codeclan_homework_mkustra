# The Brief from NHS Borders

In order to help inform the planning for provision of cancer treatment services 
in NHS Borders, we would like to gain better understanding of the incidence of 
cancer in NHS Borders.

## My Methodology

To best assist NHS Borders in their planning for provision of cancer treatment
services I decided to focus on three main areas for analysis:

* How does the total cancer incidence rate in Borders compare with the Scottish
average?
* What are the most prevalent cancer sites in NHS Borders?
* Of those most prevalent, is there any trends in age groups that could give
further insight into the provision of cancer treatments?

Through these three questions my aim is to provide insight into the occurence
of cancer in their geographical area and how they may wish plan their treatment
accordingly.

```{r message = FALSE}
cancer_5yr_data <- read_csv(here::here("5yr_incidence_health_board.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

total_incidences_data <- read_csv(here::here("Total_incidences_health_board.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Data Wrangling

```{r message = FALSE}
borders_cancer_5yr <- cancer_5yr_data %>% 
  filter(hb == "S08000016")

total_incidences_borders <- total_incidences_data %>% 
  filter(hb == "S08000016")
```

```{r}
# bind two data sets for dodged bar plot
rest_scotland_cancer <- total_incidences_data %>% 
  filter(cancer_site == "All cancer types" & hb != "S08000016") %>% 
  filter(sex == "All") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(incidences_all_ages = mean(incidences_all_ages))

borders_cancer_all <- total_incidences_borders %>% 
  filter(cancer_site == "All cancer types") %>% 
  filter(sex == "All")

cancer_bind_data <- bind_rows(rest_scotland_cancer, borders_cancer_all)

# if_else to assign a borders/scotland tag to each cancer incidence
health_board <- cancer_bind_data %>% 
  mutate(health_board = if_else(incidences_all_ages < 1000, "Borders", "Scotland"), .after = 1)
```

## How does the total cancer incidence rate in Borders compare with the Scottish average?


```{r}
dodged_cancer_plot <- health_board %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = incidences_all_ages, fill = health_board)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 24) +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Total Incidences of Cancer in Borders v Scotland",
       x = "",
       y = "",
       fill = "Health Board")

At first viewing we can see that cancer incidences in NHS Borders appear to 
follow the greater trend across the rest of the health boards in Scotland. This
could be seen as an indicator that NHS Borders are at least screening an 
appropriate amount versus the country as a whole. We can see the dip from 2019
onwards, most likely due to the decrease in cancer provisions during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

What NHS Borders can take from this is that cancer incidences have decreased
steadily over the last two years and we would expect to see a sharp rise over 
the next 1-3 years as a result of the backlog and yet-to-be-detected cancer
cases. They should not be alarmed at the trend moving in this direction as it
could be considered as simply returning to a usual rate of incidence (regressing
to the mean)

## What are he Most Prevalent Cancer Sites in the NHS Borders?

```{r}
top_five_prevalent_cancers <- borders_cancer_5yr %>%
  select(cancer_site, sex, incidences_all_ages) %>% 
  filter(sex == "All" & cancer_site != "All cancer types") %>% 
  slice_max(incidences_all_ages, n = 5) %>% 
  mutate(cancer_type = fct_reorder(cancer_site, incidences_all_ages)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_type , y = incidences_all_ages)) +
  geom_col(fill = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "5 Most Prevalent Cancers in NHS Borders Last 5 Years",
       x = "Cancer Site",
       y = "Total Incidences (All ages)") +
  theme_bw()

top_five_prevalent_cancers
```

To assist NHS Borders in deciding where their funding could be best aimed, in
terms of cancer screening/treatments, I found the 5 most prevalent cancer sites
in patients from NHS Borders. Often the best solution to lowering cancer rates 
is in early detection and screening. The top 5 cancer sites across the Borders
were:

* Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer
* Basil Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
* Trachea, Bronchus and Lung
* Colorectal Cancer
* Breast

These give an immediate actionable insight for the NHS Borders, as we can
clearly see what cancer sites are driving their incidence numbers and what they
could decide to plan extra provisions for in the treatment of these cancers.

# Age Group Spread of Top 5 Cancers NHS Borders

```{r}
age_top5_cancers <- borders_cancer_5yr %>%
  select(cancer_site, sex, incidences_age_under5:incidences_age85and_over) %>%
  rename(incidences_age05to09 = incidences_age5to9) %>% 
  filter(cancer_site %in% c("Non-melanoma skin cancer", "Basal cell carcinoma of the skin",
                            "Trachea, bronchus and lung", "Colorectal cancer",
                            "Breast") & sex == "All") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = incidences_age_under5:incidences_age85and_over, 
               names_to = "age_group", values_to = "count") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steel blue", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~cancer_site) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Incidences")
  
age_top5_cancers
```

<details>

Here we can observe the spread of age groups in the 5 most prevalent cancer
sites across the Borders to see if there are any apparent trends or areas
the NHS Borders could focus their provision planning on.

We can see that for Non-melanoma Skin Cancer, Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
and Colorectal Cancer there are peaks in the 70-74 category, plus all
subsequent age groups are as much or greater. This could lead us to thinking
that for certain cancer sites there may be an idea to pull resources in
care homes or hospices where they can focus on these age groups. 

For Breast Cancer the incidences take a leap up in the 50-54 age group and
stays roughly uniform until 80-84. This could be linked to breast screening
occurring towards the age of 50 (something NHS Borders could confirm) However, 
an actionable insight could be to introduce earlier breast screening to 
improve early detection.
