# NHS Borders Question

In order to help inform the planning for provision of cancer treatment services 
in NHS Borders, we would like to gain better understanding of the incidence of 
cancer in NHS Borders.


```{r message = FALSE}
cancer_5yr_data <- read_csv(here::here("5yr_incidence_health_board.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

total_incidences_data <- read_csv(here::here("Total_incidences_health_board.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```


```{r message = FALSE}
borders_cancer_5yr <- cancer_5yr_data %>% 
  filter(hb == "S08000016")

total_incidences_borders <- total_incidences_data %>% 
  filter(hb == "S08000016")
```

## Question 1 - Is there an overall trend in cancer rates in NHS borders?

### Plot of Total Cancer Incidences

```{r}
total_cancer_incidences_all <- total_incidences_borders %>% 
  filter(cancer_site == "All cancer types") %>% 
  filter(sex == "All") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = incidences_all_ages)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steel blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Incidences of all Cancer Types: 1996 - 2020",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Incidences (All ages)") +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 24) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))

total_cancer_incidences_all
```

<details>

There is a upward trend in the number of total cancer incidences up to 2017,
where soon after it begins to fall each year until 2020.

## Question 2 - What are the 5 most prevalent cancers in NHS Borders?

### Plot of 5 most prevalent cancers in NHS Borders

```{r}
top_five_prevalent_cancers <- borders_cancer_5yr %>%
  select(cancer_site, sex, incidences_all_ages) %>% 
  filter(sex == "All" & cancer_site != "All cancer types") %>% 
  slice_max(incidences_all_ages, n = 5) %>% 
  mutate(cancer_type = fct_reorder(cancer_site, incidences_all_ages)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_type , y = incidences_all_ages)) +
  geom_col(fill = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "5 Most Prevalent Cancers in NHS Borders Last 5 Years",
       x = "Cancer Site",
       y = "Total Incidences (All ages)") +
  theme_bw()

top_five_prevalent_cancers
```

<details>

To assist NHS Borders in deciding where their funding could be best aimed, in
terms of cancer screening/treatments, I found the 5 most prevalent cancer sites
in patients from NHS Borders. Often the best solution to lowering cancer rates 
is in early detection and screening. The top 5 cancer sites across the Borders
were:

* Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer
* Basil Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
* Trachea, Bronchus and Lung
* Colorectal Cancer
* Breast

# Age Group Spread of Top 5 Cancers NHS Borders

```{r}
age_top5_cancers <- borders_cancer_5yr %>%
  select(cancer_site, sex, incidences_age_under5:incidences_age85and_over) %>% 
  filter(cancer_site %in% c("Non-melanoma skin cancer", "Basal cell carcinoma of the skin",
                            "Trachea, bronchus and lung", "Colorectal cancer",
                            "Breast") & sex == "All") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = incidences_age_under5:incidences_age85and_over, 
               names_to = "age_group", values_to = "count") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steel blue", alpha = 0.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~cancer_site) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Incidences")
