# Facets

## Converting one plot into multiple related plots

```{r}
chick_weight <- ChickWeight %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```


```{r}


ggplot(chick_weight) +
  aes(x = time, y = weight, group = chick, colour = diet) +
  geom_line()
```

__facet based on diet__

```{r}
ggplot(chick_weight) +
  aes(x = time, y = weight, group = chick, colour = diet) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~diet)      # ~ needed to tell ggplot to facet on diet
```

__Task__

Let's load in the benefits dataset, which has data on unemployed blue collar 
workers in America.

```{r}
benefits <- read_csv("data/benefits.csv")
```


Use geom_histogram to create a histogram showing the number of unemployed by age. Then facet the graph based on biological sex.

```{r}
ggplot(benefits) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex), colour = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

Hint: geom_histogram is almost the same as geom_bar, but is better suited to 
plotting continuous data because of the binning.

## Facet with respect to multiple variables

what is we also wanted to split the plots based on marital status?

```{r}

ggplot(benefits) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(married~sex)

```

```{r}
ggplot(benefits) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  facet_grid(married~sex)
```

```{r}
ggplot(benefits) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  facet_grid(married~dkids, labeller = "label_both", scales = "free_y")
# last argument in facet grid allows ggplot to change y scale as it sees fit
```
