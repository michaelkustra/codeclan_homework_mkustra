# Read in titanic data

```{r}
titanic <- read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

# Calculate the conditional probabilities prob(survived∣crew)

```{r}

crew_col <- titanic %>%
  mutate(crew = !class %in% c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"), .after = class)


total_crew <- crew_col %>% 
  filter(crew == "TRUE") %>% 
  nrow()


total_crew_surv <- crew_col %>% 
  filter(survived == "yes", crew == "TRUE") %>% 
  nrow()

#prob ( survived | crew ) 

total_crew_surv / total_crew

```

The probability of surviving given you were a crew member was 0.2370787, or 
23.7%.

# Calculate consitional probability of (survived∣passenger)

```{r}
total_pass <- crew_col %>% 
  filter(crew == "FALSE") %>% 
  nrow()

surv_and_pass <- crew_col %>% 
  filter(crew == "FALSE" & survived == "yes") %>% 
  nrow()

# prob (survived | passenger)
surv_and_pass/total_pass
```

The probability of surviving given you were a passenger was 0.3796507, or 38.0%.

This appears to settle the dispute and indicate that you were more likely to
survive if you were a passenger.

# Question 1

## If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

__Solution__

P(<5) = 4/6 = 2/3

# Question 2

## How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

__Solution__

Since each die is independent of one another, total sample space will be 216
(6^3)

# Question 3

## In an experiment where we roll four dice:

### how many outcomes are in the event where the total of the four dice equals 5, 6 or 7)?

```{r}
s_four_dice <- rolldie(4) %>% 
  mutate(total = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4) %>% 
  filter(total %in% c(5, 6, 7)) %>% 
  nrow()
s_four_dice
```

__Solution__

There would be 9 total outcomes in this event.

### what is the probability of this event?

```{r}
9/1296
```

__Solution__

Probability of rolling all four die and receiving a total of 5, 6 or 7 is 
0.00694, or 0.7%.

### what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?

That these events are independent of one another. 

# Question 4

## Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

```{r}
permutations(5, 5) %>% 
  nrow()

1/120
```

__Solution__

120 unique permutations. Only 1 correct order (in terms of decreasing height), 
thus, probability is 1/120, or 0.008333333.

# Question 5

## 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in that order

```{r}
rolldie(6) %>% 
  nrow()
  

isin(s_six_dice, c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = TRUE) %>% 
  sum()
```

__Solution__
```{r}
options(scipen = 10)
(1/6)^6
```
0.00002143347, or 0.002%

## what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?

__Solution__

720 possible desired outcomes, 46656 total possible outcomes.
720/46656 = 0.0154321 or 1.54%.
