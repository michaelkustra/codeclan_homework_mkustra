# Hypothesis tests

__Null hypothesis: H0__

hypothesis of no change/no difference/no effect. 

__Alternative hypothesis: Ha__

hypothesis we wish to measure if there is an effect (can we reject the null
and accept this?). Would like to quantify the difference & uncertainty.

_The hypotheses must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive_

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(infer)
```

```{r}
books <- read_csv(here::here("data/books.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Clean data

```{r}
books_tidy <- books %>%
  filter(!is.na(average_rating)) %>%
  rename(num_pages = number_num_pages)
```

## Visualise the data

```{r}
books_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = average_rating)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "grey40")
```

__Our hypothesis__

Average 2016 rating was 3.93.

Is the average rating for 2020 significantly different from 2016?

_H0: There is no difference between the 2016 rating and 2020 rating_

_Ha: There is a difference between 2016 and 2020 average rating_

Hypotheses written mathematically:

$$H_0: \mu_{average\ rating} = 3.93$$
$$H_a: \mu_{average\ rating} \neq 3.93$$


```{r}
obs_stat <- books_tidy %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(average_rating))

obs_stat
```

## Hypothesis steps

_Step 1_
Set a significance level for the test, alpha, usually 0.05 or 0.01  
This is type I error rate: false positive rate

_Step 2_
Calculate the statistic we are interested in. (here is is mean(average_rating))

_Step 3_
Treat H0 as being true. Generate sampling distribution.

_Step 4_
Where does our statistic fall in our sampling distribution? Find the p-value.
ie how much of the null distribution lies beyond the observed statistic. 

_Step 5_
p-value <= alpha, then reject the null hypothesis 
p-value > alpha, fail to reject null hypothesis

# Infer worfflow

1. Calculate the _observed_ statistic
    i. Create _“flag”_ column if necessary
    ii. Specify the _response_ variable
    iii. Calculate the required _stat_
e.g. prop / mean

2. Generate the _null distribution_
    i. Specify the _response_
    ii. Indicate the _hypothesis_
What type of hypothesis (e.g. point)
Specify the proportion p (the observed stat)
    iii. Generate the _null distribution_
    iv. Calculate the _stat_ of interest
    
3. _Visualize_ the resut
Shade p-value region

4. Extract the _p-value_

## Create null distribution

```{r}
null_dist <- books_tidy %>% 
  specify(response = average_rating) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "point", mu = 3.93) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

## two sided test: direction = "both"

```{r}
null_dist %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30) +
  shade_p_value((obs_stat = obs_stat$mean_rating), direction = "both") 
```

## Calculate p-value

```{r}
p_value <- null_dist %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, direction = "both")

p_value
```

Since, 0.0198 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
