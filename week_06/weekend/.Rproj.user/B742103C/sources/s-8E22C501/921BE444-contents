## Indepenedent samples

```{r}
nice <- read_csv(here::here("data/nice.csv"))
```

```{r}
algarve <- read_csv(here::here("data/algarve.csv"))
```

## Our hypothesis

_H0: mean price in Algarve < mean price in Nice_

_Ha: mean price in Algarve > mean price in Nice_

## Combine data sets

```{r}
apart_prices <- bind_rows(nice,algarve, .id = "location") %>%
                mutate(location = ifelse(location == "1", "nice", "algarve")) %>% 
                select(-2)

# count sample size of each location
apart_prices %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
```

## boxplot of each location

```{r}
apart_prices %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = location))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

How to test if location affects price?

## make a null distribution

```{r}
null_distribution <- apart_prices %>% 
  specify(price~location) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>%    # testing independence between both price/location
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%    # permute swaps locations 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("algarve", "nice"))  # algarve goes first as the base we work from, diff of nice from algarve
```

Two sample test of difference in means

We have a mean value for sample A
We have a mean value for sample B

Our test is testing the magnitude of the difference between these two means

## Observed statistic (empirical distribution)

Comes from our data, what we observe

```{r}
observed_stat <- apart_prices %>% 
  specify(price~location) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("algarve", "nice"))
```

## visualise- shade p-value

```{r}
null_distribution %>% 
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
```

## calculate p-value

```{r}
null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
```

If H0 is true, then the data we collected would be somewhat weird.

__Task__

We have two more datasets for similar apartment lets in Corfu and Florence. Frame and perform an independent two-sample test to answer the following question:

'On average, is the price of 2-bedroom, 14-day holiday apartment lets in Florence significantly lower than that of comparable lets in Corfu?'


and frame your hypotheses before you see the data
You will need to format your data in a combined, tidy dataset prior to performing the test

_choose alpha_

alpha = 0.05

_hypotheses_

H0: mean let Florence >= mean let Florence
Ha: mean let Florence < mean let Corfu

### load data
```{r}
florence <- read_csv(here::here("data/florence.csv"))
corfu <- read_csv(here::here("data/corfu.csv"))
```

### bind data
```{r}
let_prices <- bind_rows(corfu, florence, .id = "location") %>%
                mutate(location = ifelse(location == "1", "corfu", "florence")) %>% 
                select(-2)

let_prices
```

### boxplot
```{r}
let_prices %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = location))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

### randomly assign location
```{r}
let_null_distribution <- let_prices %>% 
  specify(price~location) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("florence", "corfu"))
```


### calculate observed stat
```{r}
let_observed_stat <- let_prices %>% 
  specify(price~location) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("florence", "corfu"))

let_observed_stat
```

```{r}
let_null_distribution %>% 
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = let_observed_stat, direction = "right")
```


### p-value
```{r}
let_null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = let_observed_stat, direction = "right")
```

_outcome_

reject the null hypothesis since our p-value of 0 < 0.05.

## Paired sample - dependent samples

```{r}
books <- read_csv(here::here("data/ucla_textbooks_f18.csv"))

books <- books %>% 
  mutate(diff_new = bookstore_new - amazon_new) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(diff_new))
```

### Hypotheses

H0: µ bookstore price - µ amazon price = 0
Ha: µ bookstore price - µ amazon price != 0

Two tailed paired test

### Null distribution

```{r}

book_null_distribution <- books %>% 
  specify(response = diff_new) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "point", mu = 0) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

```

### Observed statistic

```{r}
book_observed_stat <- books %>% 
  specify(response = diff_new) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

# same as this
mean(books$diff_new)
```

### Visualise

```{r}
book_null_distribution %>%
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = book_observed_stat, direction = "both")
```

_interpretation_

observed stat (red line) shows where it lands on our bootstrapped normal dist,
appears it could be stat significant.


### p-value

```{r}
book_null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = book_observed_stat, direction = "both")
```

_outcome_

since 0.0408 < 0.05, we reject our null hypothesis.
