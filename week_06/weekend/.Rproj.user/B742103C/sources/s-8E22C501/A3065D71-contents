# 1.1 Hypothesis testing - practical

## Load Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(infer)
```

## Read in Sleep Data

```{r}
sleep <- ggplot2::msleep %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Question 1.

### Explore the dataset and familiarise yourself with it.

```{r}
# dimensions of data 
dim(sleep)

# glimpse whole data set
glimpse(sleep)
```

## Question 2.

### Jabberwockies sleep for around 7 hours a night, on average. Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the mean sleep_total in the sampled population of animal types differs from the typical value for jabberwockies.

### Hypotheses

_Null_: There is no difference in mean sleep total and jabberwockies mean sleep.

$$H_0: \mu_{sleep\ total} = 7$$

_Alternative_: There is a statistically significant difference in mean sleep total
and mean jabberwockies sleep.

$$H_A: \mu_{sleep\ total} \ne 7$$
### Alpha level

For the purposes of this hypothesis test, _alpha = 0.05_

### Calculate observed statistic

```{r}
obs_stat <- sleep %>% 
  summarise(mean_sleep_total = mean(sleep_total))

obs_stat
```

### Create Null Sampling Distribution

```{r}
null_dist <- sleep %>% 
  specify(response = sleep_total) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "point", mu = 7) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

null_dist
```

### Visualise Observed Stat on Null Sampling Distribution

```{r}
null_dist %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat$mean_sleep_total, direction = "both")
```

_Interpretation_

Visually, it appears that there may be a statistically significant difference
in the mean sleep total for the animals in our data set and the mean sleep for
jabberwockies. This is due to the extreme right location of our observed 
statistic (red line) in relation to our normal sampling null distribution.

### Calculate p-value

```{r}
null_dist %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, direction = "both")
```

_Outcome_

Since our p-value of 0 < 0.05 (alpha), we reject the null hypothesis that the
difference in mean sleep total and mean jabberwockie sleep is zero. It would 
appear that a more suitable assumption is that there is a statistically
significant difference in the mean sleep totals of animals v jabberwockies.

## Question 3.

## Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether omnivores sleep for significantly longer than herbivores, on average.

### Filter Sleep Data for Omnivores and Herbivores 

```{r}
omni_herbi_sleep <- sleep %>% 
  filter(vore %in% c("omni", "herbi"))
```

### Hypotheses

H0: The mean sleep for omnivores <= mean sleep for herbivores

$$H_0: \mu_{omnivore\ sleep} =\ \mu_{herbivore\ sleep}$$

Ha: The mean sleep for omnivores > mean sleep for herbivores

$$H_A: \mu_{omnivore\ sleep} >\ \mu_{herbivore\ sleep}$$


### Alpha Level

For this hypothesis test alpha = 0.05

### Boxplot

```{r}
omni_herbi_sleep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_total, y = vore)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


### Calculate Observed Statistic

```{r}

observed_stat <- omni_herbi_sleep %>% 
  specify(sleep_total~vore) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c ("omni", "herbi"))
  
observed_stat

```

### Create Null Sampling Distribution

```{r}
null_distribution <- omni_herbi_sleep %>% 
  specify(sleep_total~vore) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("omni", "herbi"))
  
null_distribution
```

### Visualise Null Sampling Distribution and Observed Statistic

```{r}
null_distribution %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
```

### Calculate p-value

```{r}
null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
```
__Outcome__

Since the p-value of 0.1232 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and
say that there is no statistically significant difference in mean sleep between
omnivores and herbivores. We don't have a enough evidence to reject the null 
and say that assumption holds for now.


## Question 4. 

## Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the proportion of domesticated animal types in the population of animal types is greater than 5%.

### Clean Data

```{r}
sleep_tidy <- sleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(conservation))

sleep_tidy_prop <- sleep_tidy %>%
  mutate(domesticated_flag = if_else(conservation == "domesticated", "domesticated",
                                     "undomesticated"))

```


### Hypotheses

H0: Proportion domesticated animals types = 5%

Ha: Proportion domesticated animal types > 5%

### Observed Stat

```{r}
prop_observed_stat <- sleep_tidy_prop %>% 
  specify(response = domesticated_flag, success = "domesticated") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")

prop_observed_stat
```

### Create Null Sample Distribution

```{r}
prop_null_distribution <- sleep_tidy_prop %>%
  specify(response = domesticated_flag, success = "domesticated") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.05) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

head(prop_null_distribution)
```

### Visualise Null Sampling Distribution and Observed Statistic

```{r}
prop_null_distribution %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = prop_observed_stat, direction = "both")
```

### Calculate p-value

```{r}
p_value <- prop_null_distribution %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = prop_observed_stat, direction = "right")

options(scipen = 999)
p_value
```

__Outcome__

Since the p-value of 0.0003 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and
say there is statistical significance to say that they proportion of 
domesticated animal types is greater than 5%. We are not accepting the 
alternative, rather saying we reject the null and the alternative is a more
suitable assumption for the time being.

# 1.2 Hypothesis testing - Defining the Hypothesis

## Question 1

### Solutions

__Test Used__

I would carry out a one sample proportion test.

__Hypotheses__

H0: The proportion of residents that have heard of the coffee shop is less
than 40%.

$$H_0: \pi_{residents} <\ 40\%$$

Ha: The proportion of residents that have heard of the coffee shop is 
greater than or equal to 40%.

$$H_0: \pi_{residents} > or = 40\%$$
__Method__

I would use a simulation to carry out this test with null = point and p = 0.4.

## Question 2

### Solutions

__Test Used__

I would use a two sample proportion test.

__Hypotheses__

H0: There is no difference in proportions between group A and group B.

$$H_0: \pi_{group\ A} - \pi_{group\ B} = 0$$

Ha: the proportion of users clicking on the banner in group B is greater than
the proportions of users clicking on the banner in group A.

$$H_0: \pi_{group\ B} - \pi_{group\ A}> 0$$

__Method__

I would use permutation to switch the users CTR between group A and group B.

## Question 3

### Solutions

_Test Used__

I would use a one sample mean test.

__Hypotheses__

Ho: There is no  difference in mean width from 145mm

$$H_0: \mu_{width} = 145$$
Ha: There is a significant difference in mean width from 145mm 

$$H_0: \mu_{width} \ne 145$$

__Method__

I would use the bootstrap method to create a null sample distribution.

# 1.3 Hypothesis Testing - Interpreting the results

## Question 1.

### Coffee shop problem. Significance level: 0.05, calculated p-value: 0.07

__Interpretation__

Since the p-value of 0.07 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and say
that we have insufficient evidence to say that a greater proportion than 40%
residents have heard of the coffee shop. 

## Question 2.

### Website company problem. Significance level: 0.01, p-value: 0.006

__Interpretation__

Since the p-value of 0.006 < 0 .01, we reject the null hypothesis and say
there is a statistical significance in CTR between the groups. It appears that 
there is a greater CTR when the banner is placed at the top of the screen. It 
should be said that this is only our currently working assumption until something
else comes along.

## Question 3.

### Manufacturing company problem. Significance level: 0.05, p-value: 0.55

__Interpretation__

Since the p-value of 0.55 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and say
that there appears to be no statistically significant difference in mean width
from 145mm. Again, it doesn't mean this is the conclusion, this is just our
current working assumption based on the evidence.
