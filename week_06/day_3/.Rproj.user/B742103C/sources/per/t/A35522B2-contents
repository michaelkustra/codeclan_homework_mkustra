# Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(infer)
```

# Question 1

## Load the data again, clean_names(), and re-familiarise yourself with it

```{r}
ames <- read_csv(here::here("data/ames.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
glimpse(ames)
dim(ames)
```

# Question 2

## Investigate the distribution of lot_area. Is the distribution roughly normal? If not, what problems do you find?

```{r}
lot_area_plot <- ames %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lot_area)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "grey40", fill = "seagreen", bins = 30)

lot_area_plot
```

__Solution__

No, lot_area does not appear to be normally distributed. The data appears very
narrow and appears to be skewed to the right.

# Question 3

## Compute and visualise a bootstrap sampling distribution for the mean(lot_area) of the sold houses.

```{r}

mean_lot_area <- mean(ames$lot_area)

mean_lot_area

bootstrap_sample_100 <- ames %>% 
  specify(response = lot_area) %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

bootstrap_sample_100
```

```{r}

bootstrap_sample_100_visual <- bootstrap_sample_100 %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30)

bootstrap_sample_100_visual

```
__Interpretation__

From this plot we can visualise our bootstrap distribution and how it looks
similar to a normal distribution.

# Question 4

## Use your bootstrap distribution to calculate a 95% CI for mean(lot_area), and visualise it on the distribution

```{r}
bootstrap_95_ci <- bootstrap_sample_100 %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_95_ci
```
__Interpretation__

We would expect that 95% of the time our population parameter to lie within the
range of this confidence interval of 9898.358 - 10408.25.

# Question 5

## You would like to know the mean(lot_area) of the sold houses with higher confidence. Calculate the 99% CI for this variable (you can re-use your bootstrap distribution from above). Is it narrower or broader than the 95% CI? Does that make sense?

```{r}
bootstrap_99_ci <- bootstrap_sample_100 %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_99_ci
```

__Solution__

The 99% confidence interval is (slightly) broader than the 95% confidence 
intervall. This is to be expected since we would expect to capture more
sample means within our interval, thus it should be broader.

# Question 6

## Calculate the point estimate of the mean(lot_area)

```{r}

point_estimate_lot_area <- bootstrap_sample_100 %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(stat))

point_estimate_lot_area
```

__Interpretation__

Our point estimate of 10157.43 lies almost in the middle of our 95% and 99% 
confidence intervals which illustrates that we can be confident our bootstrap 
and point estimate are suitable estimates of the population parameter mean
lot_area. (Well 95%/99% confident)
