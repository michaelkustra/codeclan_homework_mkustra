# Load Libraries

# Load / Explore Data

```{r}
housing_prices <- read_csv(here::here("data/housing_prices.csv"))

dim(housing_prices)

glimpse(housing_prices)
```

# We expect the total_rooms of houses to be strongly correlated with total_bedrooms. Use ggpairs() to investigate correlations between these two variables.

```{r}
housing_prices %>% 
  select(total_rooms, total_bedrooms) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```
__Interpretation__

The correlation coefficient comes out to 0.934, which corresponds to a very 
strong positive correlation. As you increase total rooms, total bedrooms also
increases.

# So, we do find significant correlations. Let’s drop total_bedrooms from the dataset, and use only total_rooms going forward.

```{r}
# remove total_bedrooms
housing_prices <- housing_prices %>% 
  select(-total_bedrooms)
```


# We are interested in developing a regression model for the median_house_value of a house in terms of the possible predictor variables in the dataset.

Use ggpairs() to investigate correlations between median_house_value and the predictors (this may take a while to run, don’t worry, make coffee or something).

```{r}
housing_prices %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

Perform further ggplot visualisations of any significant correlations you find.

```{r}
# plot of median_house_value ~ median_income
housing_prices %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_income, y = median_house_value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
  
```

# Shortly we may try a regression model to fit the categorical predictor ocean_proximity. Investigate the level of ocean_proximity predictors. How many dummy variables do you expect to get from it?

```{r}
housing_prices %>% 
  distinct(ocean_proximity)
```

__Interpretation__

Since there are 5 total levels of ocean_proximity, I would expect to have 4 
dummy variables after one has been used as a reference.

# Start with simple linear regression. Regress median_house_value on median_income and check the regression diagnostics.

```{r}
model <- lm(median_house_value ~ median_income, data = housing_prices)

autoplot(model)

summary(model)
```
__Interpretation__

_Residuals v Fitted_
The residuals form a steady horizontal line around 0, which suggests the
variances of errors are roughly equal. However, the residuals don't quite bounce
randomly around the zero line which suggests the linear relationship may not
fit this data well. 

_Normal QQ Plot_
The points appears to wrap around the normal line loosely, I'd have concerns
here and suggest that the test of normality isn't passed. The data is potentially
skewed.

_Scale-Location_
There is a funnel effect that has formed, with the data going from wider to
narrower for greater fitted values. This indicates that there isn't a constancy
of variance in our residuals.

_Adjusted R-Squared_
Our value comes to 0.4129. This tells us that 41.3% of the variance in our
dependent variable (median_house_value) is explained by our independent 
variable (median_income). This gives a reasonable fit, however, with the earlier
diagnostics shows that we can most likely do better.

_Residual Standard Error_
this is a large value of 74870, again, this speaks to the variance of errors
we witnessed in our diagnostic plots.

# Add another predictor of your choice. Check your assumptions, diagnostics, and interpret the model.

```{r}
model2 <- lm(median_house_value ~ median_income + ocean_proximity, data = housing_prices)

autoplot(model2)

summary(model2)
```
__Interpretation__

_Residuals vs Fitted_
Again, the line is fairly horizontal around zero, however the residuals don't
randomly bounce around the zero line which leads me to believe that it doesn't
quite fit this linear relationship well.

_Normal QQ Plot_
It is quite similar to before, it loosely falls on the normal line the middle
part of our data, however, it is not close to that thereafter. There may be
some concerns with the normality of our residuals.

_Scale-Location_
There is a similar funnel effect for lower fitted values, but the line does
keep fairly horizontal. There may still be some concern for the constancy of
variance in our residuals.

_Adjusted R Squared_
Our value has increased to 0.5528, a slightly better fit, however, we would 
expect an increase with the addition of any predictor. This now means that 55.3% 
of the variation in our response variable is explained by the predictor variables.

_Residuals Standard Error_
This has decreased to 65340, an improvement on the previous model and a slightly
better fit, however, it is still large.
